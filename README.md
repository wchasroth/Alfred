# Alfred
Alfred is my personal collection of 'helper' PHP classes.
(The name is taken, of course, from Batman's butler 'Alfred'.)

There's nothing particular special about this set of classes,
they are just things I find I keep doing over and over again,
and thus deserve to be in their own package.

See the file LICENSE for copyright and licensing information
about this package.
